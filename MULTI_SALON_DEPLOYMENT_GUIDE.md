# üè¢ Multi-Salon WhatsApp Service - Deployment Guide

## üöÄ Option A Implementation - Complete!

You now have a **unified multi-salon WhatsApp service** that runs all 3 salons simultaneously in a single Railway deployment!

## üìã What's Been Implemented

### ‚úÖ Unified Service Architecture
- **Single Service**: `whatsapp-service-unified.js` runs all 3 salons
- **Separate Ports**: Each salon has its own port (3005, 3006, 3007)
- **Individual QR Codes**: Each salon gets its own WhatsApp connection
- **Automatic Routing**: Messages are automatically routed to the correct salon

### ‚úÖ Salon Configuration
```javascript
salon_a: Downtown Beauty Salon (Port 3005)
salon_b: Uptown Hair Studio (Port 3006)  
salon_c: Luxury Spa & Salon (Port 3007)
```

### ‚úÖ Railway Deployment Ready
- Updated `Dockerfile` with unified service
- Modified startup script for Railway
- All salons run in single Railway app
- No additional Railway configuration needed

## üéØ How It Works

### 1. **True Separation**
- Each salon has its own WhatsApp phone number
- Each salon has its own QR code
- Messages sent to Salon A's number only see Salon A's services
- Messages sent to Salon C's number only see Salon C's services

### 2. **Automatic Detection**
When you scan Salon C's QR code:
- You connect to Salon C's specific WhatsApp number
- Sending "hi" automatically shows only Salon C's services
- No need for "hi salon_c" - the system knows it's Salon C

### 3. **Complete Isolation**
- Salon A customers never see Salon B or C services
- Each salon maintains its own booking system
- Each salon has its own barbers and services

## üöÄ Local Testing

### Start Unified Service
```bash
npm run unified
```

### Test All Salons
```bash
node test-unified-service.js
```

### QR Code URLs (Local)
- **Salon A**: http://localhost:3005/qr
- **Salon B**: http://localhost:3006/qr  
- **Salon C**: http://localhost:3007/qr

## üåê Railway Deployment

### 1. **Deploy to Railway**
```bash
# Push your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Implement unified multi-salon service"
git push origin main

# Railway will automatically deploy with the unified service
```

### 2. **QR Code URLs (Railway)**
After deployment, your QR codes will be available at:
- **Salon A**: `https://your-app.railway.app:3005/qr`
- **Salon B**: `https://your-app.railway.app:3006/qr`
- **Salon C**: `https://your-app.railway.app:3007/qr`

### 3. **Connection Process**
1. **Salon Owner** visits their specific QR URL
2. **Scans QR code** with their business WhatsApp
3. **Customers** can now message that WhatsApp number
4. **Automatic routing** - customers only see that salon's services

## üì± Customer Experience

### For Salon A (Downtown Beauty)
1. Customer scans Salon A's QR code
2. Customer sends "hi" to the connected WhatsApp number
3. System automatically shows only Salon A's services:
   - Hair Cut, Hair Wash, Facial Treatment
   - Barbers: Maya, Raj
4. Customer books with Maya or Raj only

### For Salon C (Luxury Spa)  
1. Customer scans Salon C's QR code
2. Customer sends "hi" to the connected WhatsApp number
3. System automatically shows only Salon C's services:
   - Premium Facial, Body Massage, Manicure
   - Barbers: Priya, Dev
4. Customer books with Priya or Dev only

## üîß Management Commands

### Check All Salon Status
```bash
node test-unified-service.js
```

### View Logs
```bash
# All salons log to same console with [Salon Name] prefixes
npm run unified
```

### Restart Service
```bash
pkill -f "whatsapp-service-unified"
npm run unified
```
