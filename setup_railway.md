   ```
   FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_BASE64=<your-base64-string>
   ```

**Option B: Upload File**

2. Ensure it's in the root directory

- Health check: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`

### 5. Troubleshooting

**Chrome Issues:**
- Railway containers should automatically find Chrome at `/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable`
- Check logs for Chrome path detection messages

**Firebase Issues:**
- Ensure `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` is set correctly
- Verify Firebase credentials are properly configured
- Check that your Firebase project allows server-side access

**Port Issues:**
- Railway automatically handles port mapping
- Your app should listen on the PORT environment variable
